## WORK GROUP CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
Guidelines for contributing to (and communicating with) this work group:
- You are _not_ required to be a work group member to assist in one of its goals.
  - But you do need to be a member to advocate for solutions.
  - _Action_ is emphasized in this working group, not just planning and deliberation.
- Please complete any task you’ve agreed to take on.
  - Don’t over commit to a work group task beyond your means.
- Ask for help and communicate to avoid developing in a vacuum.
  - I encourage people to ask for help from other work group members _and_ from the salt community at large.
- Put good faith effort into resolving the issue with the current toolset before requesting to add/replace a tool. 
  - No one is to add a tool without deliberation and consent

## WHY JOIN THE DOCUMENTATION WORK GROUP?
### Improving open source documentation has a big impact
Good documentation helps orient newcomers, improves the project’s overall usability, and ensures that the community continues to grow. Even small contributions make a big difference.

### Users at any skill level can contribute
If you’re new to Salt and want to contribute as a community member, the Documentation Work Group is one of the best groups to join because it has a low barrier to entry for contribution. You’ll get more familiar with Salt and what it’s like to contribute while working on a low-stress project that will be appreciated by the entire community.
If you’re a seasoned user, your expertise can be valuable because you will have a better sense of what users really need to get out of the documentation. All contributions are welcome!

### Documentation makes a difference
In 2017, GitHub conducted the Open Source Survey, which sampled 5,500 respondents. One of the key takeaways was that “documentation is highly valued, but often overlooked.” The survey found that outdated or confusing documentation was a major problem, affecting 93% of respondents. Yet 60% of contributors rarely or never contribute to documentation. Consider giving back to the community by helping improve the docs.
