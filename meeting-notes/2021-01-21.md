### Community Doc Jam preparations

- Progress reports:
  - Derek and Alyssa have been setting up the new repo and populating it with
    content.
  - We've also been coordinating technical reviews of the source content.
  - Derek and Alyssa tried converting one chapter to .rst and noted problems or
    things we need to tell doc jam contributors.
- Proposed timeline:
  - **Week starting with Jan. 25:**
    - Reviews of the source content should be complete and Alan will incorporate
      any insights from the review into the guide.
    - Coordinate with Sage and Janae to begin publicity for the community docs
      jam.
  - **Week starting with Feb. 1:**
    - Alan is field testing the Salt Study Guide in a training class one more
      time.
    - Derek or Alyssa will ensure a copy of the Google Docs have public access.
    - Derek or Alyssa will coordinate to build out the tickets for the docs jam
      and all of the supporting participation documents (style guide,
      contributing to the docs guide).
  - **Week starting with Feb. 8:**
    - Make sure everything is ready for the docs jam!
  -     Alan's source document is currently broken up into several small chapters
    with each comprising one Google Doc. In the previous Docs working group, we
    had decided to break up the conversion task by section (i.e. 1 section = 1
    ticket). Alan instead recommends breaking it up by chapter (i.e. 1 chapter
    = 1 ticket). We adopted this suggestion.

  - TBD

### Next docs working group meeting: February 4, 2021
