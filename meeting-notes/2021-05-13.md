## Going forward

The goal of the next Salt Docs Working Group is to transition toward an action-oriented
approach: assigning issues, seeking help with issues, and working toward achieving
the long-term goals by completing tasks step-by-step.

The main focus will be on:
- [`salt-user-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide)
- [`salt-install-guide`](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-install-guide)

#### `salt-user-guide`

- Complete "clean up" of `salt-user-guide` documentation
  - Jim has been using a [GitLab issue board for tracking](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide/-/boards/2310057)
  - MR reviews need to to happen, and merges
- Section on [Lab setup for Vagrant/VirtualBox and/or Docker](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide/-/issues/45)
- Left-hand nav TOC review
  - Clean it up by not having all documents be at the top-level. Instead of only captions,
  should the docs be in a drop-down left-hand nav?

#### `salt-install-guide`

- Salt Platform Support
  - Converting over the Supported Operating Systems PDF to `.rst`
  - Converting over the _Salt version lifecycle_ page from the Wordpress site to `.rst`
- Installing Salt
  - Page per base OS target on [`repo.saltproject.io`](https://repo.saltproject.io/): Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, etc.
  - Native minions documentation: [MR/WIP: Native minion install and config docs](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-install-guide/-/merge_requests/5)
  - OS targets [in `salt` docs](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/installation/index.html#platform-specific-installation-instructions) that are not on `repo.saltproject.io`
    - Should be own drop-down section/nav similar to Native Minion docs
- Get feedback from Frode on how code snippets can be modified for best QA/testing automation
  around release time.

#### Both repos

- Sphinx `v4.x`: Transition to the latest major release of Sphinx, and test that
  the extensions we use will work. We should also take advantage of one feature
  I was waiting for: [Allow user to use url to reference html logo & favicon](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/8737)
- [Salt style guide improvements, tooling, and automation](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/open/docs/salt-user-guide/-/issues/25)
  - `vale` and style guide
    - Basic `vale` style guide file for `salt`
      - Either store main file in `salt-user-guide`, or `salt-branding-guide`, or its own repo
    - Documentation on how to make use of `vale`
    - Any usage of `vale` that can be called by CI and/or `pre-commit` we should make use of
  - Accessbility reporting
    - Evaluate tools like [`a11y`](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y)
    - Contribute upstream to `furo` where possible
  - Evaluate tools like [`html-proofer`](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)
- Smart quotes autocorrection
  - Derek has a simple Python script that will do so, and can use `pre-commit` to call it. Needs to be converted to a pre-commit hook that can be imported into projects.
